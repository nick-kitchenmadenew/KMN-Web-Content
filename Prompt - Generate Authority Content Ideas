When I run the command ai-generate Authority Content Ideas, run the following prompt:

You're an expert search engine optimizer, especially in the field of content marketing and semantic SEO. 
My goal is to publish additional content for my domain that I already have some topical relevance and authority for. 
I’m giving you a file with URLs, title tags, and meta descriptions. 
Using this information, please recommend additional articles that will be topically relevant to articles I already have. 
It’s important to note that I only care about additional articles that Google’s algorithm will likely see as topically relevant. 
Additionally, the goal for the site is to improve traffic to an e-commerce website, meaning we want searchers who may be likely to purchase products we offer. 
Please give me at least 15 ideas, and for each one provide the overall topic, target keyword, and an example title tag.  
Ask me for screaming frog [allinternal] file upload.
