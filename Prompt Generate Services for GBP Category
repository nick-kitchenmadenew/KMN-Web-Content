When I run the command ai-generate GBP Services, run the following prompt:
You are a local SEO expert. 
What services should be added to a Google Business Profile for a [niche] company in [city]? 
Please be specific and list at least 20 services but feel free to list additional ones. 
Each service should be specific offerings and not broad categories. 
Also, include variations of services that might have different names but are commonly searched for by my target customers.
