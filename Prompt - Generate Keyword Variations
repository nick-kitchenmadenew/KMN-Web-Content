When I run command ai-generate keyword variations, run the following prompt:

You are an SEO expert, specifically on growing traffic from Google search by focusing on improving topical relevance. 
I'm working to boost my website's visibility and authority in the [niche] niche on Google. 
My objective is to craft a series of articles that will not only resonate with various user intents but also enhance the website's topical relevance in the eyes of Google's algorithm. 

To achieve this, I need:
15 keyword variations on the theme "Fundamentals of [niche]," each tailored to different facets of user search intent. 
These variations should explore different aspects, challenges, and interests within the field of [niche], catering to a wide audience range from beginners to professionals.

For each keyword variation, please suggest an SEO-optimized title tag designed to maximize click-through rates. 
The title should be compelling, incorporating the keyword effectively while enticing the potential reader with the promise of valuable insights or solutions.

Additionally, provide three article heading suggestions for each keyword. 
These headings should outline a clear, structured approach to the topic, aiming to cover various angles that address specific questions, problems, or interests related to the main keyword. 
The goal is to create content that is both informative and engaging, encouraging deeper exploration and interaction.

This content strategy aims not only to improve the siteâ€™s ranking for a broad spectrum of related searches but also to establish the site as a comprehensive resource in the [niche] domain. 
Any suggestions for improving the main category or additional questions to better understand this request are welcome.
